# deadman — logs when gift-healthcheck.sh's output goes stale on atlas.
#
# Generic by design (name|path|max_age_minutes watch entries, space-separated
# for more than one), but the default here only watches this project's own
# health-check writer — it is not a general atlas monitoring script. If atlas
# ends up needing a shared deadman switch across multiple projects, that
# belongs in a shared ops repo, not vendored into each project that uses it.
#
# Cron runs it a couple minutes offset from the writers it watches. For each
# watch entry it checks the file's mtime; entering or leaving staleness is
# logged once to deadman.log. Touches a heartbeat file every pass — if
# deadman itself dies, that file goes stale and a human (or a future
# watcher) can tell.
#
# Optional: DEADMAN_NOTIFY="some-command" in the crontab receives one line per
# event on argv — wire up push/email when the fleet has a working channel.
#
# Override for testing: DEADMAN_WATCH, DEADMAN_STATE, DEADMAN_LOG, DEADMAN_BEAT.
