## Commentaries and Reference/

20 classic, mostly-19th-century public-domain Bible commentaries and reference works,
downloaded directly from the [CrossWire SWORD Project](https://www.crosswire.org/sword/)
module archive — the same source library used by free Bible-study apps like AndBible
(Android), Xiphos and BibleTime (Linux/Windows/Mac).

### What's here

Every module's exact license text is in its own `mods.d/<name>.conf` file
(`DistributionLicense=` / `About=` fields) — that's the authoritative source, the table
above just summarizes it. **`rwp` is the one exception to "public domain"** in this set:
keep it if free-for-personal-study is fine for your purposes, delete `mods.d/rwp.conf`
and `modules/comments/.../rwp` if you want a strictly public-domain-only collection.

### How to actually read these

This is **not plain text** — it's the standard SWORD module format (a `mods.d/` folder of
`.conf` metadata files + a `modules/` folder of compressed data), the same format used
across the whole CrossWire ecosystem. To read it, point a free SWORD-compatible app at
this folder as its module directory:

- **Xiphos** or **BibleTime** (free, open-source, Linux/Windows/Mac) — in either app's
  settings, add this folder (`Study Guides/Commentaries and Reference/`) as a SWORD
  install/module path, or copy its contents into `~/.sword/` (Linux/Mac default SWORD
  data path) and it'll pick them up automatically.
- **AndBible** (free, open-source, Android) — has its own module manager, but can also
  import modules placed in its SWORD data folder on-device.
- **diatheke** (CrossWire's official CLI, part of `sword-tools` on most Linux distros —
  `sudo apt install sword-tools`) lets you dump any module to plain text from the
  terminal, e.g. `SWORD_PATH="./Study\ Guides/Commentaries\ and\ Reference" diatheke -b mhcc -k "John 3:16"`.

If you'd rather have plain, no-software-required text files, the classics here (Matthew
Henry, JFB, Barnes, Clarke, Wesley, Nave's, Easton's, TSK) are also freely available as
plain-text/EPUB ebooks on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) and
[CCEL](https://www.ccel.org) — worth grabbing directly if the SWORD format is more
friction than you want.

CrossWire's full module list (~460 works, including many more commentaries, dictionaries,
and original-language tools like Hebrew/Greek morphology and lexicons) is browsable at

download-a-zip, extract-into-this-folder pattern.
